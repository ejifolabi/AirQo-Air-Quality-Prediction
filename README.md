# AirQo-Air-Quality-Prediction
# Introduction
Air quality prediction is crucial for mitigating the adverse effects of pollution on public health and the environment. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict air quality indices based on historical data and various environmental factors.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes historical air quality data, meteorological data, and other relevant environmental factors. The data is sourced from reliable air quality monitoring systems and meteorological stations.

# Methodology
Methodology include:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and removing outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions and identifying key features.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model performance.
Data Normalization: Scaling features to ensure uniformity

Models
Several machine learning models were built and evaluated:

Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
Gradient Boosting Regressor

Evaluation
The models were evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metrics
Results
The Random Forest Regressor performed the best with the following metrics:

RMSE: Reduced to below 6
